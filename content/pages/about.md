Welcome! I'm Anna, and I'm currently a product manager at Google. When not working on optimizing our Search engines, I can usually be found nose in a book or swamped by my 1000+ Pocket articles reading about city planning, systems thinking, linguistics, and cognition. I'm also a trained dancer and love expression through contemporary dance.
